## Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with Taipy, you'll need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install taipy
```

For more detailed installation instructions, including system requirements and optional dependencies, refer to the [Taipy Installation Guide](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/installation/).

### Core Concepts

Before diving into the cheat sheets, it's important to understand some core concepts in Taipy:

- **Scenario**: A scenario represents a complete data processing workflow, consisting of tasks, pipelines, and data nodes.
- **Pipeline**: A pipeline defines a series of tasks that are executed in a specific order to process and transform data.
- **Task**: A task is a unit of work that performs a specific operation, such as data loading, transformation, or machine learning.
- **Data Node**: A data node represents a piece of data that flows through the pipelines and is consumed or produced by tasks.
- **Configuration**: Taipy uses configuration files to define scenarios, pipelines, tasks, and other settings.

For a more in-depth explanation of these concepts, refer to the [Taipy Core Concepts Guide](https://docs.taipy.io/en/latest/core_concepts/).

## Taipy Core

### Scenarios

A scenario is the top-level object in Taipy that encapsulates the entire data processing workflow. Here's an example of defining a scenario:

```python
from taipy import Scenario

scenario = Scenario(
    id="my_scenario",
    pipelines=[pipeline1, pipeline2],
    frequency="D",  # Daily execution
    start_date="2023-01-01"
)
```

For more details on creating and managing scenarios, see the [Scenarios Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/scenarios.md).

### Pipelines

A pipeline consists of a series of tasks that are executed sequentially to process data. Here's an example of defining a pipeline:

```python
from taipy import Pipeline

pipeline = Pipeline(
    id="my_pipeline",
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3]
)
```

For more information on creating pipelines and managing task dependencies, refer to the [Pipelines Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/pipelines.md).

### Tasks

A task represents a unit of work that performs a specific operation on data. Taipy supports various types of tasks, such as Python functions, SQL queries, and machine learning models. Here's an example of defining a Python function task:

```python
from taipy import task

@task(id="my_task")
def process_data(data):
    # Perform data processing
    processed_data = ...
    return processed_data
```

For more examples and details on different types of tasks, see the [Tasks Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/tasks.md).

### Data Nodes

Data nodes represent the input and output data of tasks in a pipeline. They define how data flows between tasks. Here's an example of creating data nodes:

```python
from taipy import data_node

input_data = data_node(id="input_data", storage_type="csv", path="data/input.csv")
output_data = data_node(id="output_data", storage_type="database", db_username="user", db_password="password")
```

For more information on configuring data nodes and supported storage types, refer to the [Data Nodes Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/data_nodes.md).

### Configuration

Taipy uses configuration files to define scenarios, pipelines, tasks, and other settings. The configuration files are typically written in TOML format. Here's an example configuration file:

```toml
[scenario]
id = "my_scenario"
pipelines = ["pipeline1", "pipeline2"]
frequency = "D"
start_date = "2023-01-01"

[pipeline.pipeline1]
id = "pipeline1" 
tasks = ["task1", "task2"]

[pipeline.pipeline2]
id = "pipeline2"
tasks = ["task3"]

[task.task1]
id = "task1"
function = "process_data"
inputs = ["input_data"]
outputs = ["intermediate_data"]

[task.task2]
id = "task2" 
function = "analyze_data"
inputs = ["intermediate_data"]
outputs = ["output_data"]

[task.task3]
id = "task3"
function = "visualize_data" 
inputs = ["output_data"]
```

For more details on configuring Taipy scenarios and leveraging advanced configuration options, see the [Configuration Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/configuration.md).

## Taipy GUI

Taipy GUI is a powerful tool for building interactive web-based user interfaces for Taipy applications. It allows you to create dynamic pages, layouts, and controls with minimal code.

### Pages

Pages are the top-level components in Taipy GUI. They represent different views or sections of your application. Here's an example of creating a page:

```python
from taipy.gui import Gui, Markdown

page = """
# Welcome to My App

This is the home page of my Taipy application.
"""

Gui(page=Markdown(page)).run()
```

For more examples and details on creating pages and navigating between them, refer to the [Pages Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/gui/pages.md).

### Layouts

Layouts define the structure and arrangement of controls on a page. Taipy GUI provides a flexible grid system for creating responsive layouts. Here's an example of defining a layout:

```python
from taipy.gui import Gui, Markdown, Button

page = """
<|layout|columns=2 1|
<|
# Left Column

This is the left column content.
|>

<|
# Right Column

<|Button|label=Click Me!|on_action=button_clicked|>
|>
|>
"""

def button_clicked(state):
    print("Button clicked!")

Gui(page=Markdown(page)).run()
```

For more information on creating layouts and arranging controls, see the [Layouts Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/gui/layouts.md).

### Controls

Controls are the interactive elements in Taipy GUI, such as buttons, input fields, dropdowns, and more. They allow users to interact with your application. Here are a few examples of using controls:

```python
from taipy.gui import Gui, Markdown, Button, Input, Dropdown

page = """
# Controls Example

<|Input|label=Name|value={name}|>
<|Dropdown|label=Favorite Color|options=Red,Green,Blue|value={color}|>
<|Button|label=Submit|on_action=submit_form|>
"""

def submit_form(state):
    name = state.name
    color = state.color
    print(f"Name: {name}, Favorite Color: {color}")

Gui(page=Markdown(page)).run()
```

For a comprehensive list of available controls and their usage, refer to the [Controls Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/gui/controls.md).

### Styling

Taipy GUI allows you to customize the appearance of your application using CSS styles. You can apply styles to individual controls or create global styles for consistent branding. Here's an example of styling a button:

```python
from taipy.gui import Gui, Markdown, Button

page = """
<style>
.my-button {
    background-color: #4CAF50;
    color: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 4px;
}
</style>

<|Button|label=Styled Button|class_name=my-button|>
"""

Gui(page=Markdown(page)).run()
```

For more details on styling your Taipy GUI application, see the [Styling Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/gui/styling.md).

### Callbacks

Callbacks allow you to define actions that are triggered when certain events occur, such as button clicks or input changes. They enable interactivity and dynamic behavior in your application. Here's an example of using callbacks:

```python
from taipy.gui import Gui, Markdown, Button, Input

page = """
<|Input|label=Name|value={name}|>
<|Button|label=Greet|on_action=greet|>

<|Markdown|id=output|>
"""

def greet(state):
    name = state.name
    state.output = f"Hello, {name}!"

Gui(page=Markdown(page)).run()
```

For more information on defining and using callbacks, refer to the [Callbacks Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/gui/callbacks.md).

### Deployment

Taipy GUI applications can be easily deployed to various platforms, such as web servers or cloud services. The deployment process typically involves bundling your application and its dependencies into a distributable format. Here's an example of deploying a Taipy GUI application using Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

## Taipy REST

Taipy REST allows you to expose your Taipy scenarios and pipelines as RESTful APIs, enabling integration with other systems and services.

### Endpoints

Endpoints define the available API routes and their corresponding HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.). Taipy REST automatically generates endpoints based on your scenarios and pipelines. Here's an example of defining a custom endpoint:

```python
from taipy.rest import Rest, endpoint

@endpoint(path="/custom", methods=["GET"])
def custom_endpoint():
    return {"message": "Hello from custom endpoint!"}

rest = Rest()
rest.run()
```

For more details on creating and customizing endpoints, refer to the [Endpoints Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/rest/endpoints.md).

### Authentication

Taipy REST supports various authentication mechanisms to secure your APIs, such as API keys, JWT tokens, and OAuth. You can configure authentication at the application level or for specific endpoints. Here's an example of enabling API key authentication:

```python
from taipy.rest import Rest, endpoint, auth_required

@endpoint(path="/protected", methods=["GET"])
@auth_required(type="api_key")
def protected_endpoint():
    return {"message": "Access granted!"}

rest = Rest(auth_config={"api_key": "secret_key"})
rest.run()
```

For more information on configuring authentication and authorization, see the [Authentication Cheat Sheet](cheat_sheets/rest/authentication.md).
